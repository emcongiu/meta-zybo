Build Instructions
==================

The following instructions require a Poky installation (or equivalent).

Initialize a build using the 'oe-init-build-env' script in Poky. Once
initialized configure bblayers.conf by adding the 'meta-zybo' layer. e.g.:

	BBLAYERS ?= " \
		<path to layer>/oe-core/meta \
		<path to layer>/meta-zybo \
		"

To build a specific target BSP configure the associated machine in local.conf:

	MACHINE ?= "zybo-zynq7"

Build the target file system image using bitbake:

	$ bitbake core-image-minimal

Once complete the images for the target machine will be available in the output
directory 'tmp/deploy/images'.

Additional documentation can be found in the 'docs/*' directory of this layer.
